Checklab
Checklab is an open-source archived library that preserves abandoned, crucial, and future-oriented repositories, research papers, and digital assets.
It exists to give forgotten innovations a second life, enabling people to study, collaborate, and build upon them.

Whether it's an incomplete AI model, an old simulation, or a concept paper with promise — Checklab is where it’s stored, explored, and potentially revived.

What It Is
A community-driven archive of abandoned yet meaningful digital work.

A collaborative platform for researchers, developers, and explorers to revisit and build upon forgotten ideas.

A space where digital artifacts that never got their chance are given one.
