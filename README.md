Checklab is an open-source archival platform designed to preserve and expose abandoned but crucial repositories, research papers, and future-facing digital artifacts. It serves as a shared library where individuals and teams can study, collaborate, and revive forgotten or overlooked works that hold potential for future innovation.

Built with Next.js (App Router) using Turbopack and TypeScript, Checklab prioritizes speed, modularity, and developer-first architecture.
